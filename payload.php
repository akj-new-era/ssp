                    <p>The payload represents the goal of the satellite. It stands for the purpose the satellite is going to serve once it is in orbit. The <b>Payload Subsystem</b> is responsible for identifying the ideal payload for our satellite after performing feasibility analysis. This subsystem has to have interacted with various subsystems for understanding their capabilities as well as know what all requirements it can set on the other subsystems to achieve the payload. The subsystem and its expertise is an important aspect when it comes to the above factors. Thus, a payload subsystem member has to “pay-for-the-load” for being in this subsystem.</p>
